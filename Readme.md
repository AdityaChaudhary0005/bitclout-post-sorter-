Python script that fetches bitclout post and it's comments and saves in CSV file in sorted format


Run the main.py and input the required fields:

The `SortedByDiamond.csv` contains the data with diamond given by author as the base for sorting

and the `SortedByTimeStamp` contains the data with timestamp as the base for sorting the comments
